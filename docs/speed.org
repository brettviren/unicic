** Serialized stats-only covariance inversion

This uses a stats-only (diagonal) covariance matrix.  It is inverted with ~*.linalg.inv()~ and not in batched mode.

On hierocles Xeon E5-2630 GeForce GTX 1060

-  600 Hz with CuPy on GPU
- 1000 Hz with Numpy and 40 CPU
- 1700 Hz with Jax   and 40 CPU
- failed with Jax on GPU - the 800 MB available RAM not enough

On kratos i9-9900K GeForce RTX 2080 Ti

- 27 Hz with Jax and 10 CPUs - why so slow???
- 1450 Hz with cupy and CPU
- 1000 Hz with cupy on GPU, 600MB
  
** Batched covariance inversion

Turns out ~*.linalg.inv()~ accepts batched first index.

But, implementing on hierocles leaves cupy speed unchanged for both
CPU and GPU.  Maybe it's not really batched.
